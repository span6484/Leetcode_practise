# Python Treasure-House

**H**ere are my python code resources, which includes the leetcode, reference book cases and challenges in the uni.  I wonder that i could improve my stand of coding, and build the integrity information Technology knowledge structure before i finished my master learning in UNSW. 

The objective for each week is try to update a leetcode question daily, if it is a medium or hard level question, try to solve it in 2 days.
